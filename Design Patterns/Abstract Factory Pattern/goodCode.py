"""
Abstract Factory Pattern â€“ Good Code Example

This code demonstrates the use of the Abstract Factory Pattern to create vehicles based on different brands (Maruti, Toyota).

Key Benefits:

1. Decouples Object Creation from Usage:
   - The main function does not depend on specific classes like Maruti or Toyota.
   - It only depends on the abstract Vehicle interface and factory abstraction.

2. Follows SOLID Principles:
   - Single Responsibility: Each factory is responsible only for creating one brand of vehicle.
   - Open/Closed: New brands can be added by creating new factory and vehicle classes without modifying existing code.

3. Clean Factory Selection:
   - A separate FactoryProvider handles the logic of selecting the appropriate factory based on the brand.

4. Easy to Extend:
   - To support a new brand (e.g., Ford), simply:
     - Create a new Ford class (implements Vehicle)
     - Create a FordFactory class (implements VehicleFactory)
     - Add a new condition to FactoryProvider

This pattern is ideal when multiple families (brands) produce objects that share the same interface but have different implementations.

# maruti_models.py

# from factory import VehicleFactory
