"""
 Issues in this code (before using Factory Pattern):

1. Tight Coupling:
   - The client code directly depends on specific classes like Car and Truck.
   - Any change in these classes requires changes in the client code.

2. Violates Open/Closed Principle:
   - Adding a new vehicle (e.g., Bike) requires modifying the main logic.
   - Code is not closed for modification.

3. Object Creation Logic is Repeated:
   - Same 'if-elif' blocks are needed everywhere an object is created.
   - If creation becomes complex (e.g., requires extra setup), every place must be updated.

4. Hard to Test:
   - No abstraction/interface used â€” cannot mock or swap implementations easily.

5. Poor Scalability:
   - Each new type increases complexity in the main code.
   - Makes the code harder to maintain and error-prone.
