"""
each subscriber can have all the 3 types of notifications without modifying the YouTubeChannel class. Alice has Email, SMS, and Push Notification subscribers, while Bob has only Email and SMS subscribers. This demonstrates the flexibility of the Observer Design Pattern rather than the traditional approach where the YouTubeChannel class is tightly coupled with specific subscriber types.
"""


"""
Good Code (Using Observer Pattern):
- The `YouTubeChannel` class is decoupled from specific subscriber types by using a `Subscriber` interface.
- The `YouTubeChannel` only knows that it has a list of `Subscriber` objects which is of type Subscriber and calls their `update()` method, making it flexible and extensible.
- New subscriber types (e.g., `PushNotificationSubscriber`) can be added easily without modifying the `YouTubeChannel` class.
- This implementation adheres to the **Open/Closed Principle**: the code is open for extension but closed for modification.
- The system is **modular** and **scalable**, as new behavior (subscribers) can be added without affecting existing code.
"""


"""
Real Use Case Examples (Observer Pattern):
- **Weather Monitoring System**: The **WeatherStation** (subject) notifies various **observers** (e.g., mobile app, desktop app, and weather website) when the temperature changes. New observers can be added without modifying the **WeatherStation** class, making the system scalable.
- **Social Media Updates**: A **SocialMediaPlatform** (subject) notifies **users** (observers) about new posts, comments, or messages. Different types of notifications (email, SMS, in-app) can be added by creating new observer classes without changing the platformâ€™s core logic.
