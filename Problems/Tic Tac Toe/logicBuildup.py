Requirements (from your understanding of the problem)

-> a standard 3x3 board (grid)

-> Two players taking turns and marking "X" or "O" in their respective move if VALID.

-> The game continues until:

- either of the player get their marks in a line (horizontal, vertical, diagonal (both) ).

- The game ends in draw (no more empty spaces left to mark)


** Important ** -  ask for any other core requirements that he wants me tp focus on such as board size, 2- player or more. The interviewer may tell you to focus on core things like:-

-> move validation to ensure no invalid moves

-> detection of Win or Draw scenarios

Talking about Design Patterns here:-
-> Strategy pattern could be implemented for different players having their own makeMove()
-> Factory pattern could be incorportated for creation of different players.


In Future:-
-> State pattern can manage player status changes, either switching to the next playerâ€™s turn or updating the current player to winner."
-> Observer pattern could be included to notify players about their turn, log details, game status changed etc.
