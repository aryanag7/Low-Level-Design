"""
In bad design, JuiceMachine creates and depends directly on OrangeJuicer.
This fuses high-level logic to a specific low-level tool, violating DIP.

With Dependency Inversion, JuiceMachine depends only on a Juicer interface.
The actual tool (e.g., OrangeJuicer, AppleJuicer) is injected from outside.

This makes the system flexible, testable, and loosely coupled.
